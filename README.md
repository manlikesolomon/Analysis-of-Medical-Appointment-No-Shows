# Analysis-of-Medical-Appointment-No-Shows

This project aims to analyze the no show appointments data set containg data from 100k medical appointments in Brazil with a column telling us wether the appointments were attended or not.

The goal of this analysis is to find the characteristics of features among no show appointments and to determine what factors are most important when we are trying to predict whether a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment or not.
